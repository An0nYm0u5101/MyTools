The KeyCade Nano is a teeny tiny game console that could theoretically 
be put on a keychain.  Though it would probably be better if it had a 
a case or something silly like that.

## How to use the KeyCade Nano

Power on your KeyCade Nano, and — after the splash screen — you will
be presented with a list of games.

Use the up and down buttons on the joystick to navigate to the game you
want to play, and then press the A or B button to start.

You can return to the main menu at any time by clicking the joystick while
Pressing both the A and B buttons at the same time.
