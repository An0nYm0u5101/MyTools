They are Hacking Programming, they work hard, so they should play hard... or something like that.  
Really it is the place I describe and document my public projects.

## The projects

* [Termux Call Flooder](Termux-Call-Flooder.md) — a teeny tiny game console that could theoretically be put on a keychain. 
* [CleverThing Jr](CleverThingJr.md) — Coming soon!
